They make their mark with ever-evolving blends and select single-origin releases featuring the best available green coffees, meticulously roasted. They cut no corners. We can try and tell you why it\u2019s so good, but we\u2019d much rather show you. So the answer is, yes, it\u2019s damn good."},{title:"Your bags are 340g/12oz of beans. How many cups does that make?",content:"It depends on the cup. In our home brewing methods we\u2019re typically using about 15g of beans for each 8oz cup of coffee \u2014 so a 340g/12oz bag yields about 23 mugs. We love sharing brew tips, so hit us up anytime to talk about the brew methods you\u2019re exploring."},{title:"What is your roast style?",content:"Always delicious. The lightness or darkness of a roast is just one of many factors that affect your coffee and we encourage folks to explore broadly before deciding to embrace only one style. We\u2019re lighter than some, darker than others; the \u201clighter side of medium\u201d sounds about right, but everyone is grading on different curves."},{title:"Do you offer pre-ground coffee?",content:"We don\u2019t. A lot of coffee\u2019s flavor falls off after the coffee is ground and stuff starts to taste pretty flat. We\u2019re happy to recommend grinders we like. A good grinder is the second best investment you can make in your morning coffee\u2014after scoring great fresh roasted beans of course."},{title:"How do you source your coffees? Do you offer Fair Trade, Organic, or other third-party certifications?",content:"We\u2019re certification agnostic \u2014 though many of the coffees we bring in do have organic, Fair Trade, or other certifications, we aren\u2019t participants in any of the licensing agreements to display those marks. We buy our green coffees from smaller importers and exporters who emphasize transparency and long term relationships with growers and mills. There is a small (but growing), increasingly strong and competitive high-end green coffee market that\u2019s emerged in recent years that offers much higher premiums to growers than the old fair trade minimums. Certifications have been good (in some, not all countries) at establishing a floor for sustainable practices and prices, but they\u2019ve been surpassed by the better communication systems, technical agronomy, supply chain transparency and increased producer equity that\u2019s developed within the newer specialty coffee movement. None of which is to say that the \u201cthird wave\u201d quality coffee movement has solved all the hard problems of sustainability, but we\u2019re proud to work with the farms, mills, and green buyers we do business with and think they represent a strong slice of the current vanguard when it comes to best practices."},{title:"Why blends?",content:"Single origin coffees are, quite rightly, where the action is. The last decade or so of advances in the quality coffee universe have come about because of our devotion to the distinctive details of individual selections from top farms. Recognizing the unique flavors imparted by the variety of plant, the climate and terroir of the farms, and the craftsmanship of the producers has brought us very far. But, from a culinary perspective, blending opens up vast realms of possibility we can\u2019t help but explore. The truth is that there\u2019s not a single origin coffee anywhere that couldn\u2019t be made even better with just a bit of judicious blending."}],image:"/french-press.png"},{title:"Technical Support",description:"",items:[{title:"I\u2019m having trouble verifying my Bored Breakfast NFT.
