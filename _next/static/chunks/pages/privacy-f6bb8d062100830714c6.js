Any information that you may provide to Issuer during your use of the Platform is subject to the Privacy Policy. Any information that you may provide to a Third Party Site during your use of the Platform is subject to the Third Party Site&rsquo;s privacy policy, and your use of any Third Party Site included in the Platform is governed by the terms of service of the applicable Third Party Site.</p>\n<p><strong>4.TERMINATION</strong></p>\n<p>We may, in our sole discretion at any time, for any reason or no reason, and without notice or liability, immediately terminate your access to all or any part of the Platform.

We expressly disclaim any responsibility for these risks.</p>\n<p><strong>5.1 Inherent Risks with Digital Assets.</strong></p>\n<p>There are risks associated with using Internet-based digital assets such as NFTs and cryptocurrency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum blockchain network, however caused.</p>\n<p><strong>5.2 Value/Volatility/Not An Investment.</strong></p>\n<p>The prices of NFTs can be extremely volatile and subjective, and NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value. To the extent there is a price or market for a blockchain asset such as an NFT, (a) those prices and markets are extremely volatile, (b) variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of any digital assets you own, including NFTs, and (c) there is no guarantee that NFTs will have or retain any value. NFTs are not securities or financial instruments and are not offered for investment purposes. The commercial or market value of NFTs may materially diminish in value as a result of a variety of things, including negative publicity associated with Issuer. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risks of engaging in any transactions relating to your NFTs with third parties (e.g., transferring your NFT from a third party on any so-called &ldquo;secondary market&rdquo;).</p>\n<p><strong>5.3 Use of Blockchain.</strong></p>\n<p>The Platform does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Platform&rsquo;s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum blockchain network. Any transfer of NFTs occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Network, and not on the Platform. We do not make any promises or guarantees about the availability of NFTs or that it will host your or any other NFTs at any specific location and/or for any specific period of time. Upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, a hard fork or other change to the Ethereum blockchain, a failure or cessation of the Ethereum blockchain or its underlying cryptocurrency, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using those or similar technologies, including the NFTs. We do not make any promises or guarantees related to the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum blockchain, or any other third parties related to the NFTs or the Platform (including any of their respective applications and/or services, as well as to the continued availability of or the protection or storage of any data you provide to those parties). You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any loss of access to your NFTs due to loss of your private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, mining attacks, hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks and other technological difficulties.</p>\n<p><strong>5.4 Regulatory Uncertainty.</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens and new regulations, unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of the NFTs.</p>\n<p><strong>5.5 Tax Calculations.</strong></p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform or other NFT-related transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>5.6 General.</strong></p>\n<p>You also acknowledge and agree that: (a) you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding the NFTs; (b) you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability and appropriateness of these risks for yourself; (c) Issuer does not represent or warrant that any NFTs, or its supporting systems or technology, are reliable, current or error-free or otherwise meets your requirements, that defects in the NFTs, or their supporting systems or technology, will be corrected, or that the delivery mechanism for NFTs will be free of viruses or other harmful components; and (d) Issuer shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors or delays you may experience related to the NFTs.</p>\n<p><strong>6. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING; SANCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>You understand, acknowledge, and agree that exports, re-exports and in-country transfers of any Coffee Releases or other dedeemable elements, and related services (individually, an &ldquo;Item&rdquo; and, collectively, the &ldquo;Items&rdquo;) are subject to U.S. export, import, customs, antiboycott, and economic sanctions laws, regulations, rules, and orders (each, a &ldquo;Trade Control Law&rdquo;). You shall not export, re-export, or otherwise transfer or provide any Item in contravention of any Trade Control Law, including to anyone (a) in Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, or in any other embargoed destination, or (b) listed on, or owned or controlled by anyone on, a sanctioned party list published by the U.S. Departments of Commerce or Treasury, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (a &ldquo;Sanctioned Party&rdquo;). You certify that you are not a Sanctioned Party or located in or a resident of any embargoed destination. In addition to any other remedy that Issuer may have, Issuer may suspend and/or cancel the provision of any Item if Issuer believes, in its discretion, that such activity may violate any Trade Control Law or Issuer&rsquo;s own compliance policies.</p>\n<p><strong>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</strong></p>\n<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PLATFORM, ANY NFTS, OR ANY COFFEE RELEASES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, ISSUER, COFFEE PARTNER, AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PLATFORM, NFTS, AND COFFEE RELEASES &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>\n<p><strong>8.

PAYMENT AND TAXES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>9.1 Cryptocurrency Financial Transactions on Platform.</strong></p>\n<p>Any cryptocurrency payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the Platform will be conducted solely through the Ethereum blockchain network. We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the Platform &ndash; whether NFTs or anything else. Whether a particular cryptocurrency is accepted as a payment method by us is subject to change at any time in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>9.2 Fiat Currency Financial Transactions on Platform.</strong></p>\n<p>Any fiat currency payments via credit cards or other means will be directed to our unaffiliated third-party payment processor. All bank, credit card, or other payment information is sent directly to and stored with the payment processor using its security protocols. We do not store your payment information on our systems and shall not have any responsibility for the safety or security of that information. We may add or change any payment processing services at any time. Such services may be subject to additional terms or conditions including their privacy policies.</p>\n<p><strong>9.3 No liability for Financial Transactions.</strong></p>\n<p>We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transaction that you engage in via the Platform, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum blockchain network.</p>\n<p><strong>9.4 Responsibility for Taxes.</strong></p>\n<p>With respect to all Coffee Releases, you are solely responsible for determining and paying all applicable sales, use, and/or value added taxes in your jurisdiction. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>With respect to other products that we may sell, we may charge you, withhold and pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Platform. To allow us to determine our tax obligations, you agree that we rely on your IP address. You are required to inform us if your IP address does not reflect your country of residence.</p>\n<p><strong>10.GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10.1 Age Restrictions.</strong></p>\n<p>NFTs provided by Issuer are intended for purchase and use by persons 18 years of age or older.

The failure of Issuer to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these NFT Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these NFT Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in that provision, and the other provisions of these NFT Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p><strong>10.4 Limitations Period.</strong></p>\n<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim, or cause of action you may have arising out of or related to the use of any NFTs or the Platform must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>\n<p><strong>10.5 Titles.</strong></p>\n<p>The section titles and headings in these NFT Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>\n\n<div class="passport">\n                    <p><b>Schedule 1.

The Merchant is authorised to allow for returns or refunds on orders in accordance with the Merchant\u2019s policy, including to reimburse you for the original sales prices of Products returned to the Merchant\u2019s nominated address. Passport may however refuse any return requested if a restriction applies to the item for which the return is requested. You accept that your sole remedies are against the Merchant. Where a return by the Customer is authorised by Passport or the Merchant, Passport shall also have the right to return the item to Merchant and accordingly the Merchant shall issue a credit note to Passport and Passport shall provide a credit note to the Customer, and Passport\u2019s direction, ownership and risk in the Products for return shall pass directly to the Merchant. Where a return is authorised by Passport or the Merchant, the Merchant shall, at Passport\u2019s direction and acting in its name, provide a credit note to the Customer to the extent of the value of the Product(s) authorised to be returned directly to the Merchant. In relation to any return of Products to the Merchant, you authorise Passport and its nominated agents to act on your behalf, and to recover for its own account, any import duties and taxes. If required, you will sign any such document that is reasonably required to facilitate the return of the Products and the recovery of any import duties and taxes.</p>\n\n                    <p>9. <u>General Terms.</u> The following general terms apply whenever you place a Qualifying Customer Order through the Merchant\u2019s website:</p>\n\n                    <p>9.1 <u>Compliance with Applicable Laws.</u> You certify that any Products purchased through a Qualifying Customer Order will not be imported, exported, sold, or transferred in violation of any applicable laws, including without limitation the United States Export Administration Regulations or applicable United States sanctions and embargoes administered by the United States Treasury Department, and equivalent statutes, regulations and codes of England and Wales or the EU.
